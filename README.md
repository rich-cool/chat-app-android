Chat App Android
================
Currently, this repository demonstrates only the login functionality of a generic android chat app. 

*README* files are located in all relevant folders in order to assist with the navigation of this project. These files consist of up to three of the following sections:

* *Files*
* *Folders*
* *Navigation*

Files
---------------------------------
*Files* gives a brief explanation of *files* located in the current directory that are of relevance. At the moment, the current directory contains only unedited/auto-generated files, and so no files will be included in this section.

Folders
---------------------------------
Similar to *Files*, *Folders* gives a brief explanation of *folders* located in the current directory that are of relevance. For example:

### app [(app)](./app)

Files related to app implementation.

Navigation
---------------------------------
*Navigation* helps to guide further down the project structure and avoid unedited and or auto-generated files. It consist of either a *Next Folder* header, *Previous Folder* header, or both. For instance, the current navigational path is as follows:

### Next Folder

---> app [(chat-app-android/app)](./app)
